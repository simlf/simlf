Iâ€™m a *software engineer* exploring the intersection of tech, automation, and decentralization.

**ðŸ’¡ What Iâ€™m into:**

-  Building **automated workflows** that feel like magic.
- Exploring the possibilities of **smart contracts** and **decentralized apps** (dApps).
- Experimenting with tools that make development more **fun** and **efficient**.
 
**ðŸ“« Curious?**
